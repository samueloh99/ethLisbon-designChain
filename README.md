The DesignChain is a web3 application built on the @polygon network that allows users to receive valuable feedback on their designs. By leveraging blockchain technology, our platform incentivizes active participation and rewards users for providing insightful feedback.

## Features

- **Seamless Design Feedback:** Users can upload design images and receive feedback from the community by allowing others to pin comments directly on the image.

- **Blockchain Integration:** The application is built on the @polygon network, utilizing The Graph for seamless interaction with the smart contract. We have also integrated Filecoin for secure storage of design images and related information.

- **Cryptocurrency Transactions:** Ape Coin, our native cryptocurrency, is used for all transactions within the platform. Users can deposit, transfer, and receive Ape Coins securely.

- **Enhanced Security:** We have implemented Lens Protocol for user authentication and profile creation, ensuring a secure and accountable environment.

- **Voting and Rewards:** Users can vote on feedback and comments provided by others. At the end of the feedback period, the top five users with the most votes receive a share of the cryptocurrency pool.
